  Allegorithm is a hybrid of algorithm and allegory, a series of images sampled from people and objects that exist in reality and recreated in the computer through techniques such as 3D scanning and inverse modeling, flesh and blood. Virtual cutouts of clothing, hyperrealistic objects and humans are reconstructed and rendered in the computer. The mixed scenes of virtual and reality are reproduced by the computer in an alchemical way, rendered as aesthetic and surreal visions of sameness. The high-definition rendering of anthropomorphic computer modeling images makes it impossible for the viewer to distinguish the reliability of the presence of human objects. Classical religious painting-like compositions are constructed under the blurred allegory.
